S. but but Europe as well so American investors look at this and say you know what I'm going to sell some stocks take my money and maybe buy something safe like bonds and just chill out for awhile yeah I think you have a combination of you know back to being the worries about %HESITATION you know some some problems in while it may be a smaller country or countries elsewhere %HESITATION transmitting back over to the U. S. that's part of it you're right in saying we had a phenomenal year in the market last year we've gone in three times longer than kind of historic norms without even a five percent pullback in the markets I think there is a bit of that as well and the sad meeting today still expecting ten billions and ed dollar taper their argument the interesting thing is the developed world the economy has continued to look pretty strong and we got good numbers out of the UK we expect good a GDP numbers out of the U. S. later this week so yes I think they're going to continue with their plan alright bill stone thank you so much thank you well down in DC not just a state of the union last night we got the version of the farm bill set for a vote today in the house of representatives two years in the making for this bill including a cut in automatic payments to farmers each year but as marketplace's David girl reports reforming subsidies may not save the government much money for almost two decades farmers have gotten what are called direct payments from the government a check from Uncle Sam no matter what where %HESITATION direct payment you got paid the payment even if you had great yields and high prices or Barnaby teaches agricultural economics at Kansas State University last year those direct payments cost taxpayers about four and a half billion dollars Bruce Babcock's an economics professor at Iowa state he says crop insurance is one of the things that would replace those payments and that would be a big deal but it's not clear that it's actually getting the government at all out of the subsidy business that's because these payments will be tied to commodity prices so they'd fluctuate taxpayers would save money when prices are high Babcock explains but if they fall significantly we will be spending a lot more money on farm subsidies then we would have with under the old programs wag prices fall they don't tend to rebound overnight Babcock says it's likely would face many years of high subsidy payments in Washington I'm David Gora for marketplace mn marketplace morning report is supported by investors Northern Ireland Northern Ireland European location with a young well educated agile work for already more and in fast and by constant contact offering small businesses online tools like social media event and email marketing from one log in at constant contact dot com sustainability coverage is supported in part by they can deduct fund furthering values that contribute to a healthy planet get ready for the digital equivalent of a land rush basically more than a thousand new internet addresses called top level domains are about to become available not just dot com dot org but things like dot biker maybe dot Lizzy marketplaces Mitchell Hartman reports starting today a regular Joe small bike shop owner will be able to buy a web address that's really specific to his business for you Joe yeah so this is Joe Joe Billy I hear it Joe bike high and cycling store in Portland Oregon his websites Joe dash bike dot com pretty good so does he need Joe bike dot bike isn't that kind of overkill I mean immediately who would be looking at a dot bike I mean I'm not going to invest in a destination that people don't even know exists but then I tell them it'll probably cost less than fifty dollars a year and Joe says it probably is worth getting to stick out his brand in case dot bike does take off other new top level domains go on sale this week including dark clothing and dot photography by next year there will be well over a thousand more in foreign scripts and from major brands like dot apple most new domain names will cost ten to forty dollars a year but some hot ones will push into the tens of thousands to buy like dot buzz I don't think there's a strong need for the additional extensions I just think it's a easy way to build a high margin business if you're the person that selling on Erin wall is an expert in search engine optimization and he thinks consumers will be confused so they'll keep clicking to the standard dot coms and dot org's that they know and trust Karen McCarthy worked at the international nonprofit that's in charge of this massive internet expansion he certainly knew domains will catch on and make it easier for people to connect to their communities and interests online and so if you if you're not bike shop or if you just a bike fanatic USA when I get up bike with one of these extensions I think the intent was to reflecting a life's work goes on in life more closely McCarthy says new top level domains in foreign scripts like Cyrillic and Arabic will expand global use and ownership of the internet as well I'm Mitchell Hartman for marketplace we've got stories in fact checks from last night's state of the union our website marketplace dot org in New York I'm Lizzie o'leary with the marketplace morning report nnj from AP and American pie media mn money it's a fine idea but you know it's kinda made up Kim Kardashian is famous for being famous that coin is valuable because a lot of people agree to value I'm kinda result how does a made up currency retain its value anyway will tell you next time a marketplace for me yeah mn
