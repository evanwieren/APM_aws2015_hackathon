nndb he'd internet domain gets some new domains marketplace morning report is produced in association with the university of southern California from APM in New York I'm Ben Johnson exploring the latest on how technology is changing our lives in our society today marks the beginning of a big land rush on the internet companies that manage and sell web addresses are set to release a bunch of new ones into the world these new dresses will be top level domains or TLDs they deal with the letters to the right of the dot for instance dot guru dot to bike and dot to singles dot Mitchell Hartman isn't on the list but he's the marketplace guy who brings us this story starting today a regular Joe small bike shop owner will be able to buy a web address that's really specific to his business both for you Joe yeah so this is Joe Joe Billy I hear it job by I and cycling store in Portland Oregon his websites Joe dash bike dot com pretty good so does he need Joe bike dot bike isn't that kind of overkill I mean immediately who would be looking at at dot bike I mean I'm not going to invest in a destination that people don't even know exists but then I tell them it'll probably cost less than fifty dollars a year and Joe says it probably is worth getting to stick out his brand in case dot bike does take off other new top level domains go on sale this week including dark clothing and dot photography by next year there will be well over a thousand more in foreign scripts and from major brands like dot apple most new domain names will cost ten to forty dollars a year but some hot ones will push into the tens of thousands to buy like dot buzz I don't think there's a strong need for the additional extensions I just think it's a easy way to build a high margin business if you're the person that selling on Erin wall is an expert in search engine optimization and he thinks consumers will be confused so they'll keep clicking to the standard dot coms and dot org's that they know and trust Karen McCarthy worked at the international nonprofit that's in charge of this massive internet expansion he certainly knew domains will catch on and make it easier for people to connect to their communities and interests online and so if you if you are not bike shop or if you just a bike fanatic USA when I get a bike with one of these extensions I think the intent was to reflecting a life's what goes on in life more closely McCarthy says new top level domains in foreign scripts like Cyrillic and Arabic will expand global use and ownership of the internet as well I Mitchell Hartman for

values that contribute to a healthy planet this month a neuroscientist in his team and now it's that the ceremonial first kick at this year's World Cup opening in Brazil would be completed by a paralyzed teenager using an exoskeleton attached to their brain prosthetic robotic devices connected to the human brain are becoming more common you may remember a video a few years ago of a woman at the university of Pittsburgh feeding herself chocolate with the robot arm Welford today's installment of our sports in Texier is gaming the system won't hear from a guy who works in this field doctor Michael bowling Jr is chair of the physical medicine and rehabilitation department at the university of Pittsburgh Dr thanks for joining us my pleasure thanks for having me I understand there's a number scale as you judge how a human might interact with the prosthetic that's being controlled by their brain so a simple way of thinking about this is one degree of freedom of control means that you can actually control the movement of an object along the line kind of similar to the game of space invaders where the little alien that shot things just moved back and forth along the bottom of the screen what's the next level up to degrees of freedom would be controlling a mouse really along two lines now up and down and side to side and then it gets even more complicated and more degrees of freedom troll here I get the impression that you're a little bit skeptical about the possibility of someone who is paralyzed being able to actually stand up and kick the first ball in the World Cup I think it's an achievable task there are several of those exoskeletons in existence and they have a computer chip on board that actually does a lot of the control work for them where it becomes much more difficult would be if the brain was responsible for controlling the motion of the like that itself and this is a very I would imagine slow process of having total control and being able to do it in a live sports situation well sure if you could give someone are actual skeleton that made them stronger then you'd have this super athlete because they'd fake it instead of having to travel down the nerves in our body which are relatively slow compared to electrical wires sweet we wait hold on hold on you're telling me that our neural network is not as fast as electronic wires yeah we don't have it figured out to the degree where we can do that but Balzac it happen more quickly with electronics so what are the barriers that remain then you know one barrier there remains is that in the absence of sensation it's hard to get really robust and good control that I imagine is a very complicated technological hurdle part of my interaction as someone he's playing with the basketball or playing with the soccer ball is how the ball feels especially in a sport where the high level athletes do everything on believably while it's not just their ability to reacted to their ability to sense that you know if the basketball is rotating you can tell that by when you're dribbling a basketball doctor Michael bonding Jerry is the chair of the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the university of Pittsburgh's school of medicine doctor banning Jr thank you very much thank you very much for you can find more of our gaming the system series on our website
