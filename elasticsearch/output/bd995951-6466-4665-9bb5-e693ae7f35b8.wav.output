S. middle class and yes he did get around to his signature domestic policy achievement the affordable Care Act here is talking about enrollment more than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage nnj I've got marketplaces healthcare reporter Dan Gorenstein here with me live to do a little fact checking hi Dan Hey Lizzy alright nine million how solid is that number yeah you can slip into some quicksand real fast here Lizzy Philip that's be clear technically nine million is accurate about three million people enrolled through the federal or state health exchanges and about six million of signed up for Medicaid the program that's primarily for the low income Americans but remember here's the thing insurance isn't static people are signing up and re enrolling all the time so my so nine million doesn't really mean nine million new people signed up for example Medicaid some people getting access due to the Medicaid expansion which started this year but some already had Medicaid and just re enrolling these numbers should get clear though in the next couple of months one of the goals of the ACA was to get coverage for people who didn't have insurance before do we know how many new people or get insurance look that's another unknown Lizzy earlier this month the survey came out from accusing company showing that only about eleven percent of people who bought policies on the exchanges were previously uninsured that's remember though those numbers are not confirmed and it's expected to change by the March thirty first deadline the president also said if misfortune strikes you don't have to lose everything kind of the point of insurance put some numbers behind that for us yet though I need some context under the ACA their out of pocket maximums for how much going to have to pay if things get really bad about six thousand dollars for an individual thirteen thousand dollars for a family but those caps don't apply if you see a doctor who isn't in your network we all know Lizzy that health care's really complicated and people have got to understand so you're watching enforced thank Stan you now let's do the numbers nter bands need gap about two point seven percent in London the FD one hundred down four tenths of a percent stock futures here in the U.
