dnmt looks like there might be a parallel boost out there for doing new work for the federal government marketplace morning report is produced in association with the university of southern California from a PM in New York I'm Lizzie o'leary in for David Brancaccio president Obama's state of the union speeches tonight and the White House is starting to release snippets of information about it including a minimum wage of ten dollars and ten cents for folks working on new federal contracts our Washington correspondent David Gergen joins me live now Hey David Hale is in so explain this minimum wage boost what income inequality something the president said he wants to tackle in his second term text in issue that politicians on on both sides of the aisle are talking about the president has been clear that he wants to raise the minimum wage for everybody for every job but the head is something that he can't do without help from Congress that this is this is kind of a workaround in heather McGee explains why she's with the think tank demos she is right now as the chief executive the biggest boss of low wage workers in the country there are a lot of federal contractors Lizzy half a trillion dollars worth of them and the white house's said changing their minimum wage I would make a difference more importantly perhaps it's something the president can do and white houses were quick to add this would only affect new contracts got it so so this is part of his sort of go it alone strategy things he can do without Congress that's exactly right in the president is clearly frustrated with Congress that he and his aides have been talking about in relying more on what they call the phone in the pen to get things done so the pen here is a a clear reference to executive actions like raising the minimum wage for contract workers and Republicans aren't thrilled with this Lizzie as you might expect but I think they know there's a limit to what the president can do obviously he could do more with their help and you can just look back at the debate over gun control for instance on the president pushed through I think twenty five executive orders do they make a difference I think Hina supporters would say yes but I think it's fair to say %HESITATION they could accomplishment that they accomplished much Leslie set out to do initially David Carr I know you're putting much more about this for the rest the days of thank you very much thank you now let's do the numbers mn the Dow's up almost four tenths of a percent to fifteen niner six the SNP five hundred also almost four tenths of a percent to seventeen eighty nine the nasdaq up almost one tenth of percent a forty eight east seven at the moment well next time you take out your smartphone for a game of angry birds are to check Facebook linkedin Twitter whatever there's a chance you're not the only one is watching documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in part by the New York times the guardian and ProPublica show that the British and American governments could be tracking data from some mobile apps to talk about it we're joined by the BBC's security correspondent Gordon Carrera good morning devoting so why would the government yours or mine care if I'm playing say angry birds well I guess the question is who do they care about of people when they play games a when they use a mapping applications put him personal information these applications suck out personal details about where you might be and that's useful to intelligence agencies they will say they use this against legitimate targets who might be using applications on the iPhone and who they might want to try to get information about you've got a real conflict here between part of the business model of these applications where they'd like to know where you are so they can sell you mobile ads and the government's purpose they want to know where you are for different reasons do we have a sense of how consumers right react to this yet well I think that's what's really interesting about this is that it raises many questions for the software companies that develop these at as for the intelligence agencies because of course people may not realize when they sign up for these apps when they signed on those terms and conditions which people often don't read they often are giving away that data that's what the spy agencies are intercepting but of course it's information that the companies are collecting and often monetizing and so this may highlight to people just how much data they are leaking a personal information they are leaking I may make the more cautious about that because they don't want the spy agencies but also because they don't want the tech firms to be using it and I think that's just one of the ways in which all these revelations are causing problems for the technology industry Gordon career the BBC security correspondent thank you so much thank you nndb
