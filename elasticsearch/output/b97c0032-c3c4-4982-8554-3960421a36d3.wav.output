nndb breaking down the state of the union with our in house experts marketplace morning report is produced in association with the university of southern California from a PM in New York I'm Lizzie o'leary and for David Brancaccio in last night's state of the union speech president Obama focused on income inequality wages jobs and the U. S. middle class and yes he did get around to his signature domestic policy achievement the affordable Care Act here he is talking about enrollment more than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage nnj we got marketplaces healthcare reporter Dan Gorenstein to do a little fact checking hi Dan Hey Lizzy alright nine million how solid is that number yeah you can slip into some quicksand real fast here Lizzy Philip that's be clear technically nine million is accurate about three million people enrolled through the federal or state health exchanges and about six million of signed up for Medicaid the program that's primarily for the low income Americans but remember here's the thing insurance isn't static people are signing up and re enrolling all the time so nine million doesn't really mean nine million new people for example Medicaid some people getting access due to the Medicaid expansion which started this year but some already had Medicaid and just re enrolling these numbers should get clear though in the next couple of months one of the goals of the ACA was to get coverage for people who didn't have insurance before do we know how many new people or get insurance look that's another unknown Lizzy earlier this month the survey came out from the cans in company showing that only about eleven percent of people who bought policies on the exchanges were previously uninsured let's remember though those numbers are not confirmed and it's expected to change by the March thirty first deadline so you're watching of course

fans by a dedicated console that only plays Nintendo games so will the company make its games available on other platforms analyst Michael Pachter is dubious I don't think there's a chance that they'll do that they should but I don't think that they have any intention of it Nintendo is making a strategy announcement this week Jeff Ryan thinks they may try to play nice with other people's software but not how you think people are trying to invite intended to their party but instead Nintendo was going to bite the other people to Nintendo's party he thinks they'll increase the range of
